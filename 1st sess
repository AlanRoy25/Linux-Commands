How to edit a file in terminal : nano or vim text editors

nano notes.txt ( to create a new file )   --- we can use ctrl + key to search along the text file.

/etc/passwd". ----- (the one of the hidden file or the file which may have the pwd )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


FINDING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:

which, find : command can be used to search any files
locate : it can be used to locate the files easily.
eg:
locate *.conf
eg: 
find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null

Options and their descriptions :

-type f	: Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, 'f' stands for 'file'.
-name *.conf : name is to identify the name * for all files and .conf to find the extension of file.
-user root	: This option filters all files whose owner is the root user.
-size +20k	: We can the-size +20k	We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.
n filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.

newermt 2020-03-03	: With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented.
2>/dev/null	: This is a STDERR redirection to the 'null device', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must not be an option of the 'find' command.
